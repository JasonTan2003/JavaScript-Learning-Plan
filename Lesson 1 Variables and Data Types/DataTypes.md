# JavaScript has 8 DataTypes:

1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint (used to store integer value that are too big ðŸ˜¼ )
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

## The object DataType

The object data type can contain both built-in objects, and user defined objects:
Built-in object types can be: objects, arrays, dates, maps, sets, intarrays, floatarrays, promises, and more.

## Most programming languages have many number types:

Whole numbers (integers):
byte (8-bit), short (16-bit), int (32-bit), long (64-bit)

Real numbers (floating-point):
float (32-bit), double (64-bit).

Javascript numbers are always **_one type_**:
double (64-bit floating point).
