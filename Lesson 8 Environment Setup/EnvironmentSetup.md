# Setting Up the Environment (React Native)

There are several prerequisites that needs to be fulfilled before we can start working with React Native:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Install a code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with extensions for React Native.
3. Choose between **Expo CLI** or **React Native CLI**:
   - **Expo CLI:** Easier for beginners and it handles many configurations for you.
   - **React Native CLI:** Offers more flexibility and is closer to real-world production setups.
4. Set up an emulator (Android Studio or Xcode) or test directly on a physical device.

## How to Setup the Environment in VS Code using the Expo Framework?

Open up the terminal in VS Code and run the following command: ![Create a new project with expo](/Assets/createExpoCommand.jpeg)

Note that the command above, will initialise a project structure with TypeScript by default.  
If you want to work with plain JavaScript, you can achieve it by adding the **--template** option. See [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/more/create-expo/#--template).

If you want to initialise a project with JavaScript, below is the command:

**With that you can now start working with React Native**.
